# README - PetsData
## Welcome to the repository for the PetsData exercize project!
This project is part of the Microsoft Guided Projects series, designed to help you learn practical skills in a hands-on environment.


### Project Overview
- Add predefined sample data to the pets array.
- Iterate a "menu options and user selection" code block to establish the outer loop of your application.
- Implement code branches corresponding to the user's menu selections.
- Display all the information contained in the array used to store pet data (based on user's menu selection).
- Iterate an "add new animal information" code block that enables the user to add one or more new animals to the pets array (based on user's menu selection).


### Learning Objectives
- Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses a combination of selection and iteration statements to implement logical workflows.
- Evaluate the underlying conditions in your application and make an informed decision between selection statement options.
- Evaluate the underlying conditions in your application and make an informed decision between iteration statement options.
- Scope variables at an appropriate level within an application.
